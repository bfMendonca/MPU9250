## Invensense MPU-9250 SPI Library

Library to interface with Invensense MPU-9250 9-DOF IMU using the SPI protocol. 

Forked from Brian Chen.

I intent do modify this library in order to make it compliant with STM32CubeMX library for SPI and, with that, compatible with ST Arm MCU's

*Does not* use the built in DMP of the IMU; only reads raw data.

**What works**
- Gyro
- Accelerometer
- Magnetometer?
